This has been a project that has been on my mind for a while.  It has been 18 years since my first and last large scale open source project.  The landscape for developing an open source project has totally changed from back then.  Various companies have generous resources to help get things running.  Various other open source projects are very resourceful in building things fast.

Anyway.. the plan is to build a simple, scalable, superfast, search and analytics engine.

I have never tried blogging before and this blog is my attempt in getting that out of the way.  If I am not bored, will continue to update the blog regularly about the development, my thought process and decisions made through the course of building MarlinSearch.

I plan on getting this to a useable state hopefully before the thanksgiving holidays.  I should be able to work a few hours every night on this.

PS: Why MarlinSearch?  Marlin is one of the fastest fish in the ocean and I got the domain you are reading this blog on :)
